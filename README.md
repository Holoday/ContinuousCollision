This mod adds Continuous Dynamic type Collisions to KSP â€” vessels will no longer phase through each other when travelling at high speeds.

Continuous Collisions works automatically on all loaded vessels during flight. If you wish to disable it, open the GUI via the stock toolbar and uncheck Enabled.

Continuous Collisions is mainly intended for use in stock combat.


Thank you for using Continuous Collisions.
