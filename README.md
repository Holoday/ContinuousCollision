KSP Continuous Collisions 0.1.0
_______________________________

After you've loaded all the vessels you want to use, open the GUI via the toolbar, select continuous-dynamic and click apply. You may need to re-apply it each time you load a quick save. If you'd like to switch back to default collisions for increased performance, select discrete and click apply. It's unknown how this interacts with vessel packing/unpacking at the default distance of 200m, you may need to install PhysicsRangeExtender. 

Thank you for using Continuous Collisions. This is VERY early in development, and thus we are not responsible for any crashes or issues.
