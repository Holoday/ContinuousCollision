Continuous Collisions 1.0
_______________________________

Changes:

 - Removed manual collision mode selection.
 - Added a setting to enable speculative dynamic collision, enabled by default. Speculative collision is slower and produces slightly more damage. With speculative disabled you need to switch away from projectiles before they hit or it will cause everything to explode.
 - Added saving and loading of settings.


Info:

This mod adds Continuous Dynamic type Collisions to KSP â€” vessels will no longer phase through each other when travelling at high speeds.

Continuous Collisions works automatically on all loaded vessels during flight. If you wish to disable it, open the GUI via the stock toolbar and uncheck Enabled.

Continuous Collisions is mainly intended for use in stock combat.
