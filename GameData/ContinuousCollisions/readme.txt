Continuous Collision 0.2.2
_______________________________

Changes:

 - Small improvements to the automatic detection.


Info:

This mod adds Continuous Dynamic type Collisions to KSP â€” vessels will no longer phase through each other when travelling at high speeds.

Continuous Collisions works automatically on all loaded vessels during flight. If you wish to disable it, open the GUI via the stock toolbar and de-select 'Auto'. This will open a new list from which you can manually select between different collision modes, including KSP's default mode "Discrete".

Continuous Collisions is mainly intended for use in stock combat.
